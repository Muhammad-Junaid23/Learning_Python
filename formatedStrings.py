# formated strings are similar to back ticks in javascript
# syntax : f"{variable_one } {variable_two}"


# previously we use below syntax but it is ugly
# first_name = "Star"
# second_name = "Alone"
# full_name = "Star" + " " + "Alone"
# print(full_name)

# now we use formated strings
first_name = "Unknown"
last_name = "404"
full_name = f"{first_name} X {last_name}"
print(full_name)
